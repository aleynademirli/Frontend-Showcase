# 📚 HTML & CSS Author Showcase Project

A static frontend project built with HTML5 and CSS3, showcasing multiple authors through structured content, responsive layout techniques, and CSS-driven navigation.

The project demonstrates a strong focus on semantic HTML, modular CSS architecture, and thoughtfully designed interaction implemented without JavaScript or external libraries.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The HTML & CSS Author Showcase Project is a static, section-based webpage designed to present literary authors through structured content, clear visual hierarchy, and refined UI styling.

Navigation between sections is implemented using anchor links and the CSS `:target` pseudo-class, enabling smooth, CSS-driven interaction across the page.

The project focuses on clarity, consistency, and maintainability while applying modern layout techniques and thoughtful design principles.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

This project was designed to:

- Strengthen the use of **semantic HTML** for clear and meaningful structure
- Apply CSS for layout composition, interaction states, and subtle animations
- Implement navigation logic without relying on JavaScript
- Practice **Flexbox-based layout systems** for responsive alignment
- Create a visually balanced, readable, and consistent user interface
- Demonstrate attention to detail through micro-interactions and UI refinement

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Sticky, glassmorphism-inspired app bar
- Anchor-based internal section navigation
- Active section highlighting via the CSS `:target` pseudo-class
- Flexbox-driven layout system for structured content alignment
- Card-based UI pattern for featured works
- Hover-based micro-interactions and elevation effects
- Gradient-driven backgrounds and UI elements
- Fully static, dependency-free architecture with no JavaScript

## 🧩 Technologies & Techniques

### 🧱 HTML5

- Semantic, section-based document structure
- Anchor-based navigation using ID targeting
- Accessible image implementation with descriptive `alt` attributes
- Clear and consistent content hierarchy (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`)

### 🎭 CSS3

- Flexbox-based layout system for alignment and spacing
- Core box model usage (margin, padding, border, border-radius)
- Pseudo-classes for interaction states (`:hover`, `:target`)
- Pseudo-elements for decorative and UI enhancements (`::after`)
- Smooth transitions and keyframe-based animations
- Visual styling using gradients, shadows, and blur effects
- Modular, reusable class-based styling approach

## 🎨 UI & Styling Decisions

- Glassmorphism-inspired app bar implemented with `backdrop-filter`
- Consistent use of border-radius values to maintain visual cohesion
- Hover-based feedback on navigation links and content cards to enhance usability
- Section focus animation to guide user attention during navigation
- Subtle motion design choices prioritizing clarity over distraction
- Warm and readable color palette selected for comfortable content consumption
